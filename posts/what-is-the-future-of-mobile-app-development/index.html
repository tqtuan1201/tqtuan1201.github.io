</aside>
<p>A new year has started and most of us are probably figuring out what we should focus on this year. Whether it‚Äôs learning new things or expanding our knowledge on topics we‚Äôve already learned about in the past, there‚Äôs always something that deserves our attention in the world of iOS development.</p>

<p>As per the statistics, over 5 million apps are available in Google Play Store and Apple App Store. For more innovative solutions, the business needs Top Mobile App Development Trends for end-to-end Software development that helps the business grow continuously. However, the demand increases with a rise in technology and the digitalization world.</p>

<h3 id="trend">Trend</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AI &amp; Machine Learning</strong></p>
<p>After the ground-breaking success of FaceApp, most of the folks were wondering: <strong>What‚Äôs next?</strong> That‚Äôs when AI brought something that propelled my expectations to a whole new level. The MyHeritageApp brought a <strong>powerful photo</strong> <strong>animate feature that converts pictures into realistic animations.</strong> AI and ML have been amongst the top mobile app development trends for the last few years in a row. But these technology advancements set the bar for mobile app development for 2022 very high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rise of 5G</strong></p>
<p>5G will change the way <strong>we build and use apps</strong>. Speed and efficiency will significantly improve. Here are a few things we can expect. Overall, the 5G technology will make apps faster, smoother, and more efficient.</p>
<ol>
<li>V<a href="https://www.netsolutions.com/insights/video-streaming-apps-ux-design/">ideo streaming apps</a>¬†will see a significant improvement.</li>
<li>AR and VR as integrating these technologies into the app will be easier.</li>
<li>Developers to build new features without negatively affecting the¬†<a href="https://www.netsolutions.com/mobile-app-performance-optimization/">app performance</a>.</li>
<li>Mobile payments will be quicker and more secure because of the faster processing of biometric data for identification</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apps for Foldable Devices</strong></p>
<p>According to¬†<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/983531/global-foldable-phone-shipments/">Statista</a>, 50 million units will be shipped in 2022. So, it‚Äôs time you also keep <strong>foldable devices</strong> in mind while planning out your mobile app development strategy. Make sure your apps run <strong>seamlessly on foldable devices</strong> ‚Äî a challenging mobile app development trend in 2022.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/foldables">Unfolding the device</a>¬†to provide a larger screen can have a positive impact on users:</p>
<ol>
<li>A larger screen means more space for a detailed and immersive experience.</li>
<li>With multi-windows, a user can perform multiple tasks at the same time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AR &amp; VR</strong></p>
<p>The success of Pokemon Go may have been temporary, but it paved the way for AR in mobile app development. It showed the world that we could practically use VR to offer an immersive experience to users.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ikea uses AR to let users see how furniture will look at their home before buying it.</li>
<li>L‚ÄôOreal has a virtual makeup app that allows users to see how the makeup looks on their faces.</li>
<li>Lenskart lets users virtually try glasses before buying them.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wearable App Integration</strong></p>
<p>Wearable devices are already ruling the world.¬†<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/487291/global-connected-wearable-devices/">According to Statista</a>, connected wearable devices reached 453 million in 2017 and will reach 929 million by 2022.</p>
<p>A<a href="https://www.netsolutions.com/hire-developers">pp developers</a> and businesses should get ready with apps that provide an excellent digital experience to users on Smartwatches and wearables, thus gaining a distinct edge over those who do not. <strong>It signifies the rise in wearable technology ‚Äî one of the essential mobile app development trends in 2022.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on Mobile App Security</strong></p>
<p>According to¬†<a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/press/2021/check-point-softwares-mobile-security-report-2021-shows-almost-every-organization-globally-experienced-a-mobile-malware-attack-during-the-past-year/">Check Point State of Mobile Security 2021 report</a>, around 46% of organizations had at least one employee who downloaded a malicious mobile application. Given how much employees depend on mobile devices, it‚Äôs a matter of concern for businesses. That‚Äôs why most businesses are looking to invest more in cybersecurity, given it is directly linked to data protection and information privacy laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Super Apps</strong></p>
<p>Such apps are called Super Apps, and they are insanely popular in Asia. However, the trend is also catching up in the west. It strives to change the way people interact with their phones allowing them to <strong>solve multiple purposes from a single app.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P2P Mobile Apps</strong></p>
<p>P2P mobile apps are another key trend that will mark the mobile app development sector. According to eMarketer, the projected worth of P2P mobile transactions will reach $612.23 billion by 2023. It means there is a huge scope for P2P mobile apps at present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blockchain | Mobile Wallets and Mobile Payments</strong></p>
<p>We first heard about Blockchain during the cryptocurrency boom. But now the technology has come a long way and is applicable in different areas. It is growing at a significant rate, and is expected to accumulate $20 billion in revenue by 2024. <strong>Blockchain is also playing a pivotal role in mobile app development.</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Mobile wallets</strong> are getting in the picture for mobile app development in 2022, where Wallet integration should become a <strong>standard feature.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Predictive Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Enterprises have been using predictive analytics in mobile apps for some time now. Netflix uses it to recommend movies and TV shows based on users‚Äô watching habits. Also, Amazon leverages predictive analytics to personalize product recommendations.</p>
<p>This year, we‚Äôll see predictive analytics going more <strong>mainstream:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>To Optimize the Development Process:</strong>¬†Enterprises can process the data gathered from developers to discover issues before they occur and suggest better alternatives.</li>
<li><strong>To improve the User Experience:</strong>¬†Businesses can use user data to predict the user‚Äôs actions and personalize their journey.</li>
</ol>
