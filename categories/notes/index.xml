        <description>When I was learning english, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to distinguish between who, whom and whose. So this post i am noting some keywords to remember. Some knowledge has been extracted from www.myenglishpages.com.&amp;quot;
 The main point &amp;ldquo;Who,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;whom,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;whose&amp;rdquo; are all relative pronouns used in English to refer to  people, animals, or things previously mentioned in a sentence.
Info Who is used as the subject of a sentence or clause (refers to the person who is doing the action).</description>
