        <description>Long time no see! Just keep doing it and you&amp;rsquo;ll reach your goals.
 Abstract So, today we will be discussing about how to design the food selection in a mobile application. In this post, we will explore
 Improve your mindset about developing applications. Working on Swift, Sketch.  Let&amp;rsquo;s do it.
 What is the purpose of the function? The main purpose is to provide more utility to customers using the 12bay application.</description>

        <description>Abstract Today we will discuss how to update the cocoapod library to support SwiftPM. Last week, I updated my TTBaseUIkit library to support Swift Package Manager. So I want to share some useful experience with you.
What is Swift Package Manager? First, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know about Swift Package Manager. I thought you read swiftpm-post to understand about this package.
 The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code.</description>

        <description>Abstract Today we will talk about dependency managers in iOS and compare their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we learn how to use those to add dependencies to your project.
Dependencies When we build applications, we often use code from other developers writing to build more powerful applications more quickly. In your projects, we can make an easy animation to hide or show the button. But if you want to add a complex animation to your project that’s not built-in.</description>

        <description>Abstract When I work with many projects. I always ask myself how to optimize the application, reusable code and how to develop the fastest and most efficient applications. So after two years of working with Swift language. I created the framework to build UI programmatically. With TTBaseUIKit, you can build apps in the fastest and most efficient way. A few points to note when you apply this framework:
 How to set up the framework Basic config settings Usage example  Introduction I have been building framework for 5 years and for now, I still update new functions.</description>

      <title>The VIPER Architecture</title>

        <description>Architecture Just like MVC or MVVM, VIPER is a design pattern created to facilitate the development by creating layers of abstraction and isolation of concerns, creating a cleaner code, and bringing more maintainability further down the road
VIPER is an acronym for View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Router. Each functionality or module must be defined by these five components.
View It’s what the user sees, the view that represents a functionality. In some cases, a single functionality can have multiple views, for example, an onboarding flow with multiple steps.</description>
