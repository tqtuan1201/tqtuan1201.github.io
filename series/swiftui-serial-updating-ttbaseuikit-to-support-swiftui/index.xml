        <description>Abstract Today, we are continuing our journey of learning SwiftUI by rebuilding the train booking feature in the 12Bay application. This function is designed to help users find trains that are available for their desired departure and arrival stations. Once users find their preferred train, the app will show them which seats are available for that specific journey. Users can then choose their preferred seat type, like window or aisle seats, and select the number of tickets they want to book.</description>

        <description>Abstract In this article, we will learn about Spacer in SwiftUI. We will dive into the world of Spacer. Exploring their purpose, functionality and practical applications. This article is part of the SwiftUI Series - SwiftUI Series - Updating TTBaseUIKit to support SwiftUI
What is the Spacer? The Spacer is a layout view that expands to fill available space within a container.
Here is the definition from Apple. You can view full details at developer.</description>

        <description>Bus booking function write by SwiftUI For three months, I dedicated myself to learning SwiftUI and using it to develop a bus booking feature. Along the way, I faced several challenges in integrating SwiftUI into an existing UIKit-based project. In my upcoming articles, I will dive deep into these challenges, providing detailed insights and solutions. But first, let&amp;rsquo;s explore the user interface for booking a ride, which includes selecting a bus route, choosing seats, and specifying pickup/drop-off points.</description>

View is a function of state, not a sequence of events - apple
Woaaaa !
SwiftUI - Apple&amp;rsquo;s declarative framework for building user interfaces. The user interface is defined based on the current state of the application, and any changes to the state automatically update the corresponding views.</description>

        <description>Abstract WWDC23 - Code new worlds - Since the event took place, I have been following updates on SwiftUI. It demonstrates the importance of SwiftUI in Apple&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem. And more than just a new product, Vision Pro shows a direction for the future, which could change the way we interact, communicate, and work. It takes time for this product to prove itself - a revolutionary product like the iPhone or not?</description>

        <description>Abstract Info SwiftUI: Itâ€™s the future I realize that now is a suitable time to learn and apply SwiftUI in the real world. So in this series, I will delve into the fundamental components of SwiftUI. With the knowledge gained, we will update TTBaseUIKit to support SwiftUI, allowing us to quickly build applications using these basic components. Additionally, we will develop a new feature called &amp;lsquo;Bus Booking&amp;rsquo; using SwiftUI on the 12Bay application.</description>
